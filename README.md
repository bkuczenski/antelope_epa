Foreground processing prototype for EPA PSM Hackathon

## Coming Soon!
The repository developed for the hackathon project was based on an unreleased software project known as [lca-tools](https://github.com/bkuczenski/lca-tools/tree/strike_uuids). I am working on a proper release of that code, after which the EPA code will be ported to use the new release. Then it will be available here. Stay tuned...

**Performance date: October 1, 2020**
